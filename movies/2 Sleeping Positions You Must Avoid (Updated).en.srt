1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,320
- I'm Brad.
- I'm Mike.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,490
And behind the scenes we have Bob.

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,510
And together we're the most famous

4
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,689
physical therapy team on the internet.

5
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,630
- Well, in our opinion, of course, Mike.

6
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,010

Now, the topic of the day is,

10
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,420
do you wake up having back,
shoulder or neck pain?

11
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,920
'Cause Brad certainly is right now.

12
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,840
- Oh yeah. Well, we're gonna talk,

13
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,480
and actually take a trip down memory lane.

14
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,150
We have a video that
has viewed by millions,

15
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,310
and very appreciative of our tips.

16
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,380
Plus, we're gonna show a couple new tips

17
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,960
at the end of the video to amend it.

18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,120
- So, go back in time.

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,266
- Woo woo woo woo woo.

20
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:39,366

23
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,600
It's not that easy.

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,330
We just can't say don't
do this and don't do that.

25
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,163
- We gotta give 'em a reason.

26
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:50,730
- We're here for a little education

27
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,559
so that once you become educated,

28
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,060
you understand, and then you do.

29
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,440
There's a whole philosophy.
- Sure.

30
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,489
- But we don't want to get into that.

31
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,280
But the biggest areas that cause,

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
that are complaints of pain,

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,890
are neck, shoulder, and back.
- And back.

34
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,740
- Right. Those are probably
the most common areas

35
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,440
that become irritated and
painful throughout the night.

36
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,509
So we've gotta take care of this,

37
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,950
and address and understand
it a little bit.

38
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,770
First of all, joints in general,

39
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,780
whether it's your, the
joints in your spine,

40
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,610
or your shoulders, or your back,

41
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,560
or whatever it may be, your neck,

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,010
wanna stay in what we call
the "loose pack" position.

43
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,307
- Right. And I like
being at the end range.

44
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:32,220
- Right. So my shoulder
here would be loose packed.

45
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,650
Up here would be end range.

46
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,483
- Right.
- Okay?

47
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:37,470
- Or back here would be end range.

48
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,550
- Right.
- So I wouldn't sleep

49
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,050
like this either.
- Right.

50
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,830
So neck, if we put our neck
over to one side this way,

51
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,450
or one side that way,

52
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,830
all the joints in your neck

53
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,500
are pushed to the end range we call it.

54
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,770
And that's uncomfortable
after a period of time.

55
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,630
Initially it may not be a problem,

56
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,270
but, you hold your neck
over like this for,

57
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,630
you know, 20 minutes or more,
it becomes uncomfortable.

58
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,270
So, keeping that in mind,

59
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,750
the next thing we wanna
do is look at the spine.

60
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,830
And not just look at it,

61
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,050
but understand the spine moves,

62
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,030
and it twists and whatnot.

63
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,520
But we wanna keep it in
a neutral position, Bob.

64
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,540
- Correct.
- Okay.

65
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,209
So a neutral position is actually

66
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,790
where there's a little
curve in the back here.

67
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,489
There's a curve in the
other direction in the-

68
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,830
- So we've got a curve
in, curve out, curve in.

69
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,670
- Right.
- Yep.

70
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,503
- Yep. So we want to keep-

71
00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:28,500
- Kinda S shape.
- Yep.

72
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,750
Keep these curves in,

73
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,370
in that kind of a general shape, you know?

74
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,380
- Yeah.
- So we're not going way out.

75
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,840
And if you look at it from the front view,

76
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,720
now that, you typically
want to keep straight.

77
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,830
- Right.
- So the curves

78
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,510
are looking from the side,

79
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,040
and this is looking straight.

80
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,299
So this will all come to play

81
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,700
when we look at our
positioning with sleeping.

82
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,950
So, anything else that I missed?

83
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,783
- No, you got it right, Brad.

84
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:51,616
- Alright. So-
- For once.

85
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:52,530
- Let's look at the position...

86
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,450
Yeah, for once.

87
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,209
Well, it happens, I was up
studying late last night.

88
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,080
- Here we go.

89
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,950
- So the first position is
we're gonna talk about prone.

90
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,170
- Okay.
- Laying on your stomach.

91
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,267
- So this is a bad position.

92
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:06,359
- Right.
- Right.

93
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,740
This is, this is a position

94
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,360
because it breaks a number of the rules

95
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,250
we just talked about that create pain,

96
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,900
gives you outta that neutral position,

97
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,640
or puts you at end range.

98
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,472
So if I'm gonna lay here,

99
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,710
let's just take a
regular pillow, Bob once.

100
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,543
- Sure.

101
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:24,600
- And there are people who sleep prone,

102
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,583
and they have for a while,

103
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,280
and they do okay with it.

104
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,830
But the problem that can
really occur when you're,

105
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,390
when you're on your stomach,

106
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,290
you almost have to have
your head one position over,

107
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,090
over to the right or to the left.

108
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,390
And that puts my neck at end range,

109
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,059
and I'm laying there for
a long period of time.

110
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,370
Now, I'm assuming people
who sleep like this,

111
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,560
that don't have pain throughout the night,

112
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,663
turn their head right to left.

113
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,022
- Well, the other thing is though,

114
00:03:54,022 --> 00:03:55,140
and I didn't see a study on this,

115
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,750
but we did do kind of an informal survey

116
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,790
of this at a classroom one time.

117
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,130
We asked how many people have headaches.

118
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,510
- Yep.
- And a hundred percent

119
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,420
of the people that laid on
their stomach had headaches.

120
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,679
- Sure.
- During the, you know,

121
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,513
- Throughout the day?

122
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:09,870
- Throughout the day
or throughout the week.

123
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,270
You know, I mean, had a
higher incidence of headaches.

124
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,620
- Okay. Sure.
- So that's something

125
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,270
to consider is that if you are

126
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,290
especially having those headaches

127
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,450
that start from back here-
- Yep.

128
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,950
- You know, the neck headaches.

129
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,940
- Yep.
- I would,

130
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,773
that's one of the things

131
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:23,610
I would definitely look into.
- Sure.

132
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,930
And I think, you know, if you're,

133
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,280
if you are a prone sleeper,

134
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,770
you may or may not have a pillow.

135
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,940
I guess without a pillow,

136
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,560
it puts you more in a neutral position.

137
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,393
But you know, still,

138
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:33,750
if you can avoid the prone position,

139
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,400
for your neck, it's gonna be better.

140
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,659
And then the other thing,

141
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,720
is if you lay in your stomach
and with your shoulders,

142
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,400
if you lay like this,

143
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,679
that puts your shoulders at end range,

144
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,180
and it also puts your,
your brachial plexus-

145
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,680
- [Bob] Brachial plexus.

146
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,510
- and they can get pinched off,

147
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,030
and actually cut the circulation

148
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,640
off into your arms or pinch the nerves,

149
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,740
and you can wake up with numb or-

150
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,360
- [Bob] I have.

151
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,680
One time I woke up,

152
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,080
both my arms were numb
to the point I couldn't,

153
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,340
and I was trying to turn the alarm off,

154
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,409
so I'm going like this.

155
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,363
(Bob and Brad laugh)
It's just-

156
00:05:04,363 --> 00:05:05,970
- Yeah.
- it's a little embarrassing.

157
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,310
- Right. So, and that's,

158
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,350
you know, there's a name for that, Bob.

159
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,400
- [Bob] What is it?

160
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,320
- When you put your arms up like this.

161
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,700
Working overhead.

162
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,630
- [Bob] Sure. What is it?

163
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,871
- I can't remember.

164
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:18,750
(Bob and Brad laugh)

165
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,330
- I know there's honeymoon syndrome where,

166
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,510
if your, you know, spouse
falls asleep on your arm,

167
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,099
that becomes numb then.
- Right.

168
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,490
- So.
- So, next position, Bob.

169
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,840
I'll think of that in just a little bit.

170
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,673
- Alright.

171
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:33,427
- Sideline. Now this is, you might say,

172
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:35,460
"Well everyone sidelines."

173
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,293
- Right.
- Most people do,

174
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:38,010
which I do myself.

175
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,760
But, oftentimes a shoulder
problem will happen

176
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,550
when you're laying on the
point of your shoulder

177
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,110
if you will.

178
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,240
And the joint, when you relax,

179
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,000
you can sublux or actually
push the ball, the joint,

180
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,950
shoulder joint out slightly,

181
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,849
and can put pressure on the
ligaments and the capsule,

182
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,980
et cetera in your shoulder and cause pain.

183
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,680
So laying like this on the shoulder

184
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,970
can really create some pain.

185
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,990
So what you'll wanna do
is pull this shoulder out

186
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,880
a little bit so you're actually on

187
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,580
a little bit of a slant here, versus here.

188
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,289
- And you actually, yeah,

189
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,580
then you're getting more on the meaty

190
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,659
part of the shoulder that

191
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,713
can handle it on the back there.

192
00:06:16,713 --> 00:06:18,900
- Yep. And that's gonna help reduce that.

193
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,530
So the sideline can be a problem,

194
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,909
but if you do these little twerks

195
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,080
that we're talking about,

196
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,913
it'll help you out.

197
00:06:25,913 --> 00:06:26,970
- We show way we can do
another thing for that too.

198
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,200
But Brad, the other thing,

199
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,430
while you're in this position,

200
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,860
the other thing is your back
is sagging a little bit.

201
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,840
- Sure. When you're in
this sideline position.

202
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,649
- Yeah. Let's get the
spine out and show that.

203
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:38,340
- So here, you know, it's straight,

204
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,159
but now it's gonna sag a little bit

205
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,993
right here in the low back.

206
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:43,860
- Yeah. Right.
- And so if you're having

207
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,820
back problems and if you,

208
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,880
especially you sleep like
this a lot all the time,

209
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,840
you should take like a rolled
towel like we did here,

210
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,789
and you can put it in that position.

211
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,640
Or there's actually a
sleep roll you can buy.

212
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,473
- Yeah.
- We have it

213
00:06:57,473 --> 00:07:00,480
in our Amazon section there by Mackenzie.

214
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,900
And this one you can actually
tie around your waist,

215
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,299
so it's in your back when
you sleep on your back,

216
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,430
or it's on your side when
you sleep on your side.

217
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,141
- Right. Yep.
- So.

218
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:11,430
- And, and you know, in my case,

219
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,940
I know I can sleep on my
side for about 10 minutes.

220
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,020
I never even get to sleep,

221
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,070
'cause my back starts to hurt,

222
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,890
then I have to go to my my back.

223
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,323
But that's just 'cause
of my spondylothesis.

224
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,660
So this is how this works.

225
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,070
This one's a little bit small for me.

226
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,210
It doesn't wrap around.

227
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,700
But people who have a disc problem,

228
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,890
often they use something like this,

229
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,760
so that here you have the
support on your low back

230
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,590
in the lor, in the lordotic section.

231
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,960
And then when you roll to either side,

232
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,690
you also have that hollow
spot being filled in.

233
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,190
- There's another possibility right here

234
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,660
besides it being too small for you.

235
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,610
Maybe your waist is too big for it.

236
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,212
- Yeah, there you go.
(Brad laughs)

237
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:51,630
- Just point out that possibility.

238
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,463
- Should we-
- Let me-

239
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:53,430
- Should we show 'em the
trick with the pillows?

240
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,140
- Yeah, sure. Let's do that.

241
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,190
- Let's pull this right here.

242
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,010
- Yeah.
- So this is a

243
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,390
cervical pillow here.

244
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,969
But another way, I'm gonna
put this on this side Brad,

245
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,430
just for my mic purposes here.

246
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,610
So, you know, generally
when you're on your side,

247
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,660
if you're gonna lay on your side,

248
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,583
you want to have a thicker pillow.

249
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,820
- [Brad] Yep.
- So that your neck

250
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,320
isn't going like...

251
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,300
Why don't you take it out once Brad.

252
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,530
It isn't going like this.
- Right.

253
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,719
- You want to have your neck
right in the middle too.

254
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,520
So this is almost a little bit-

255
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,960
- Yep.
- This one would actually

256
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,950
need to go up a little bit.

257
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,039
- Right. So, but the other key,

258
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,210
we've showed this many times,

259
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,349
is actually you take a pillow,

260
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,050
a lot of times it's
more of a throw pillow,

261
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,549
and that's what I use.
- Sure.

262
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:35,073
- And I just create the little canal here.

263
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:36,390
- [Brad] Yep.
- And you can put

264
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,380
your arm right in there.

265
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,150
And now there's not nearly

266
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,370
the pressure on your
shoulder there was before.

267
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,910
- So this is that sideline
making sideline tolerable

268
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,819
and acceptable to keep the
shoulder pain from waking you up.

269
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,220
- And now if you're having
pain in this shoulder,

270
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,510
and you don't wanna lay on it,

271
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,060
which is good, then you should actually,

272
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,819
besides the canal, well you
might not even need the canal.

273
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,170
- Right.
- But you would

274
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,660
put a pillow here, and
another pillow here,

275
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,130
and support the arm like this.

276
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,963
- Right. Right.

277
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:03,959
- And again, it puts that shoulder

278
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,930
in that loose packed position
that Brad was talking about.

279
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,579
It's not any end range,

280
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,020
and it's kinda a little bit forward.

281
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,370
- Sure.
- And it's not,

282
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,290
it's not going to cross
the body like this.

283
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,400
which is also bad.

284
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,420
- Right. Because then you're getting

285
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,510
towards that end range, and
you know, irritating them.

286
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,343
- Right here in the middle.

287
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:20,339
That's where you want to keep it at.

288
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,070
It's gonna do it well.

289
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,100
- Right. And the last thing is sideline.

290
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,650
A lot of people will
get a pillow like this

291
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,250
that actually has the form,
and it's a memory foam.

292
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,890
- Right. So get put in and
there's a gap for the neck.

293
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,500
- Right. So you get the
neck in a neutral position.

294
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,450
- Sure.
- And that's not necessary.

295
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,670
You can use a regular pillow.

296
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,410
And some people, you know,

297
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,010
I'll have some people
try just a towel roll

298
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,270
to fill in that gap to get

299
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,160
that neutral position in the neck.

300
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,650
So if I lay here now with the towel roll,

301
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,140
see how it's, it really
cradles my neck nicely.

302
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,910
- Right.
- So, and now we don't

303
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,319
have the neck sagging either.

304
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,490
- Right.
- So,

305
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,050
that's actually pretty comfortable.

306
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,870
- Yeah. If this works, but
it's not quite as cushy,

307
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,030
you may wanna invest in the memory foam.

308
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,490
They cost a little more but-

309
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,480
- Or there's the cervical roll too.

310
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,640
- Oh yeah. The cervical.
- We got all sorts of good-

311
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,439
- Yeah, there's a, there's a lot of things

312
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,180
to keep you comfortable.

313
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,099
- Mackenzie makes a roll here with

314
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,360
cervical where you can put it in there.

315
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,497
- Sure.

316
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:20,640
- And if you find the towel works well,

317
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,960
and you don't want to
keep using the towel,

318
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,280
you can go and get one of those.

319
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,113
- Right.

320
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:24,946
- So what it boils down to,

321
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:28,200
we got two positions to avoid, the prone,

322
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,720
which we don't have any solutions for.

323
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,140
And sideline, which we have
a number of solutions for

324
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,189
that we just went through.

325
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,120
So you know, we're helping you
out at least on half of the-

326
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,560
- We're half smart.
- Right.

327
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,579
Whoa! And the time
machine returns to 2024,

328
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,860
and we have Mike with us today.

329
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,500
These are in for three positions

330
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,600
that weren't mentioned in that film,

331
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,110
and Bob said we've gotta mention
these to make this updated.

332
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,760
Mike, what are the three?

333
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,770
- Well it's only two
positions, but three remedies.

334
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,603
- Oh.
- So first,

335
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:01,170
two are for stomach sleepers,

336
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,400
and then we got sideline.

337
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,270
So the first one,

338
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,400
if you are a stomach sleeper,

339
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,220
but you are having some
hip or low back pain,

340
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,610
take another pillow,
place it under your waist,

341
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,040
and you're gonna lay on that pillow there.

342
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,270
What does this do, Brad?

343
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,637
- Well it actually flexes
the hip and the low back.

344
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:20,819
And if you have stenosis
in particular like myself,

345
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,850
this makes a tremendous amount
of different in comfort.

346
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,870
Simply put it there,

347
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,210
adjust it up and down
where it feels comfortable,

348
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,890
and you'll know, 'cause it'll just feel

349
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,590
a night and day difference
if that's what you need.

350
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,730
And what about the neck?

351
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,430
- If you're having some neck
pain in your stomach sleeper,

352
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,930
I typically use two pillows.

353
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,300
I sleep in all positions
'cause I'm a weirdo.

354
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,069
Anyway, you place this here,

355
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,810
you don't want your neck to be cranked

356
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,489
all the way to 90 degrees like this.

357
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,490
I've woken up like this,
and it's very uncomfortable.

358
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,560
So oftentimes if you put another pillow

359
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,239
kind of underneath your chin,

360
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,280
and more at a 45 degree angle,

361
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,079
and I'm half talking in
the pillow right now,

362
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,490
so don't mind me,

363
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,720
it's much more comfortable.

364
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,880
Obviously you can't sleep like that.

365
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,570
So, 45 degree angle if you're
having some neck discomfort

366
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,950
and you're a stomach sleeper.

367
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,645
- Right. We don't say
cranked, we say rotated by.

368
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,943
This is a, this is a family
show, and a therapy show.

369
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:13,410
- It's a, it's a medical term, "cranked."

370
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,610
- Anyway.
- Anyways.

371
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,700
- Last one, if you're
having some hip pain,

372
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,070
side hip pain and you're a side sleeper,

373
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,500
what you can try to do is place a pillow

374
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,030
underneath your rib cage,

375
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,770
kind of above the hip,

376
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,030
above the hip, A bove.

377
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:30,000
Anyway. And then you can also

378
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,010
put a pillow underneath your foot.

379
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,680
This is gonna help rotate
your hip in a different way,

380
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,500
taking the pressure off your lateral side.

381
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,150
- That's right. A lot of these will help

382
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,829
get the spine back in the neutral,

383
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,750
whether it's in the low back or the neck,

384
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,220
making it much more comfortable,

385
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,430
so you can sleep and relax to position.

386
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,170
- Now if you watch this whole video,

387
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,002
we would like to know.

388
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,130
Comment down below, your
favorite sleeping position,

389
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,570
because we're very curious, aren't we?

390
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,980
- Right. Or if you've got another hint

391
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,660
that other people will benefit from,

392
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,520
make sure you let us
know about that as well.

393
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,930
So we help each other out.

394
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,430
And we've got another video

395
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,920
that will be helpful as
well with more detail.

396
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,703
- Yeah, so if you're having shoulder pain,

397
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,829
I don't think we addressed it much

398
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,210
in the old video or this one.

399
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,537
You can click the video link on a screen,

400
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:12,450
"How to stop shoulder pain in bed."

401
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,650
- That's right, and the famous
Bob's Eerie Canal Theory

402
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,540
and Method to eliminate shoulder pain.

403
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,709
And that's what he uses.

404
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,870
So if you wanna find out
what it is, check it out.

405
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,730
It's very, very new.

406
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,560
- No water is involved.

407
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,392
